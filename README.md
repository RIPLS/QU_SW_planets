# QUtest

## Description
The web application was developed with Angular Framework and comprises 2 screens
    - Dashboard
    - Detail 

    The first one is a dashboard page, designed to show a list of planets got from "Swapi". The data obtained from the API is shown on a 
    material Table. You can filter out the data using the navbar "search" box, as well as the "sort" options using headers of the table.

    If the user clicks on a row of the list shown on the table it will be redirected to the Detail screen. This page shows information of the selected planet and a reference image.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Used API

"Swapi": "https://swapi.dev/"
